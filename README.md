California Housing Price Prediction: Advanced ML Pipeline
Project Status: ðŸš€ Production-Ready

## Overview
This project implements a robust, industry-standard machine learning pipeline for predicting California housing prices using the classic California Housing Dataset. The pipeline features advanced preprocessing, custom feature engineering, systematic model evaluation, and comprehensive diagnostics, demonstrating best practices for real-world ML deployment.

Key Features & Industry Best Practices
Stratified Sampling for Data Splitting

Uses StratifiedShuffleSplit to ensure representative train-test splits, preserving income distribution for unbiased model evaluation.

## Advanced Feature Engineering

Implements custom transformers inheriting from BaseEstimator and TransformerMixin for seamless integration into scikit-learn pipelines.

Engineered features include ratios such as rooms_per_household, population_per_household, and bedrooms_per_room for improved predictive power.

Comprehensive Preprocessing Pipeline

Handles missing values with SimpleImputer.

Scales numerical features with StandardScaler.

Encodes categorical variables with OneHotEncoder.

Manages feature engineering within the pipeline for consistent data flow.

Systematic Model Evaluation

## Implements a 7-step evaluation methodology:

RMSE for error magnitude

MSE for overall performance

RÂ² Score for generalisation assessment

Cross-Validation for robustness and bias detection

Model Comparison for optimal algorithm selection

Residual Analysis for assumption validation and overfitting detection

Feature Importance for interpretability and decision transparency

Professional Debugging & Data Flow Management

Uses print statements and pandas methods for step-by-step data flow inspection.

Handles DataFrame-to-NumPy array conversions and NaN propagation issues for robust preprocessing.

Visual Diagnostics

Generates prediction vs. actual plots, residual histograms, Q-Q plots, and residuals vs. order for comprehensive model validation.

Feature Importance Analysis

Extracts and visualises feature importance for Random Forest models, providing insight into which features drive predictions most strongly.

## Results
